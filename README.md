# Tech-Lab

> Welcome to the Tech-Lab repository!
> This project serves as a sandbox for exploring and learning various modern technologies and frameworks. 
> The primary goal is to dive deep into diverse tech stacks, implement use cases, and understand their real-world applications.

## Technologies Covered
1. Apache Pulsar
- A distributed messaging and streaming platform.
- Explore use cases such as real-time event processing, message queuing, and streaming data.  

2. Apache Geode / GemFire
- A distributed in-memory data management platform.  
- Hands-on with caching, high-performance data regions, and cluster management.  

3. Spring Security
- A powerful and customizable authentication and access control framework.  
- Focused on securing applications with OAuth, JWT, and other authentication mechanisms.  

## Repository Objectives
1. To serve as a reference guide for configuring and integrating the listed technologies. 
2. To provide hands-on examples demonstrating best practices and real-world scenarios. 
3. To build a strong understanding of the strengths, limitations, and use cases of each technology.
